WP-Starter-Kit
==============

A WordPress theme starter kit for my future themes. 

I'm using various awesome libraries & frameworks:
* https://github.com/retlehs/roots as a theme base
* https://github.com/Gizburdt/Wordpress-Cuztom-Helper to create custom post types, taxonomies and meta boxes
* https://github.com/ghost1227/Redux-Framework to create a theme settings page
* https://github.com/sksmatt/WordPress-Widgets-Helper-Class to easily create widgets
